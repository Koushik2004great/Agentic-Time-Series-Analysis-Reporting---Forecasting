## Time Series Analysis Report: Technology Sales Forecasting

**Objective:** To develop a time series model for forecasting monthly sales in the Technology category, extracted from the `superstore_sales.csv` dataset, using the `Order Date` as the time index and `Sales` as the target variable.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Data Preparation:** The time series was extracted by filtering the data for the "Technology" category. Initial trend analysis revealed a strong upward trend with an average monthly increase of 333.15.
2.  **Stationarity Testing:** A stationarity test was conducted, indicating the series is likely stationary (p <= 0.05).
3.  **Model Identification:** Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots were examined to determine initial model orders. Significant lags were observed at lag 12 in the ACF plot, and lags 12 and 16 in the PACF plot.
4.  **SARIMA Model Selection:** A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was selected to capture seasonality. The optimal model parameters were determined through a grid search, minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

**Model Details:**

The best-performing SARIMA model was identified as SARIMA(0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1, 12), with an AIC of 739.74. This indicates a non-seasonal moving average component of order 1, a seasonal moving average component of order 1, and a seasonal period of 12 months.

**Conclusion:**

The selected SARIMA(0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1, 12) model demonstrates a good fit to the historical Technology sales data, as indicated by model diagnostics. The model is deemed reliable for forecasting future sales, as evidenced by the diagnostic checks. Forecasted sales for 2018 are provided.
